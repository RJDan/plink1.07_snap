          *  The description above refers to the software: https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/plink/
          * I have packaged the software as a snap for **personal use** but I have made the snap available for free.
          * I do not maintain the software itself. I only maintain the snap packaging. Please report software bugs to the maintainers.
          * Report snap-specific bugs to me.
            * I _DO_ use this snap. It _has NOT passed ALL the provided tests_ on my system. I __do not__ track the latest version.
            * Packaging 'style' : Binary for linux machines.
            * License refers to the original software, not the snapcraft 'code'.
            * More info:
            * Run the following to rename the snap to plink
